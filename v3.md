# Version 3

This document constitutes **version 3** of a creative coding exercise.  By way of introduction into the rationale behind the exercise project please refer to the [README](README.md).  The purpose of this document is to build upon the [previous version](v2.md) by introducing further elements to the problem space, thereby stretching the solution space. 

# TODO

- Add blockchain network to process service payments and security deposits.
- Registration:
- - Compute node operators pay a fee plus security deposit.
- - Storage node operators pay a fee plus security deposit.
- - Users pay a fee.
- Compute Payload processing:
- - Users pay a fee for each compute payload to be processed.
- - System processes fee payment **before** processing compute payload 
- - System routes a cut of each compute payload fee to:
- - - compute node operators
- - - storage node operators
- - - system treasury
