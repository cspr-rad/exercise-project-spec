# Version 3

This document constitutes **version 3** of a creative coding exercise.  By way of introduction into the rationale behind the exercise project please refer to the [README](README.md).  The purpose of this document is to build upon the [previous version](v2.md) by introducing further elements to the problem space, thereby stretching the solution space. 

# System Overview

The revised sytem is composed of 15 nodes, the nodes are split by role into 3 groups of 5. .  , each node being a single process that runs one of 2 binaries.  5 nodes, henceforth called proving nodes, will run a binary responsible for processing computational payloads within a set of supported ZK compute spaces.  The other 5 nodes, henceforth called storage nodes, will run a binary responsible for persisting ZK proofs and responding to proof queries.   

A client facing CLI program will allow a user to dispatch a computation payload to a random proving node.  The compute identifier returned by the proving node will be used to subsequently query a random storage node for a computational proof.  Optionally, the computational proof can subsequently be dispatched to a random proving node for verification purposes.


# TODO

- Add blockchain network to process service payments and security deposits.
- Registration:
- - Compute node operators pay a fee plus security deposit.
- - Storage node operators pay a fee plus security deposit.
- - Users pay a fee.
- Compute Payload processing:
- - Users pay a fee for each compute payload to be processed.
- - System processes fee payment **before** processing compute payload 
- - System routes a cut of each compute payload fee to:
- - - compute node operators
- - - storage node operators
- - - system treasury
