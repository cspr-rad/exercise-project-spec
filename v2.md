# Introduction

This document constitutes **version 2** of a creative coding exercise.  By way of introduction into the rationale behind the exercise project please refer to the [README](README.md).  The purpose of this document is to build upon the [previous version](v1.md) by introducing further elements to the problem space, thereby stretching the solution space. 

# System Overview

The revised sytem is composed of 10 nodes, each node being a single process that runs one of 2 binaries.  5 nodes, henceforth called proving nodes, will run a binary responsible for processing computational payloads within a set of supported ZK compute spaces.  The other 5 nodes, henceforth called storage nodes, will run a binary responsible for persisting ZK proofs and responding to proof queries.   

A client facing CLI program will allow a user to dispatch a computation payload to a random proving node.  The compute identifier returned by the proving node will be used to subsequently query a random storage node for a computational proof.  Optionally, the computational proof can subsequently be dispatched to a random proving node for verification purposes.

# Node Implementation

It is upto the engineer to implement as they see fit according to their ability and experience.  Sub-systems may be either functional or cross-cutting.

Functional sub-systems may include the following:

- a computation executor

- a JSON API

- a proof broadcaster

- a proof store

Cross-cutting sub-systems may include the following:

- a configuration mechanism

- a logging mechanism

- a test framework

- a fault tolerant DevOps setup

# CLI Implementation

The CLI should lightweight and simple to interact with.  It's job is to encapsulate interaction with a node on behalf of a user.  It will render data returned by the node in a simple manner.

# Testing

The following integration positive test should be implemented:

- Generate 1000 payloads of each supported payload type, 2000 payloads in total

- For each generated payload:

    - invoke `do-compute` at a random node and note returned compute-id

    - await 5 seconds
    
    - invoke `get-proof` for all nodes and assert proof equivalence

    - invoke `get-proof-validity` for all nodes and assert truthiness
