# Overview

This document constitutes **version 1** of a creative coding exercise.  By way of introduction into the rationale behind the exercise project please refer to the [README](README.md). 

The system is composed of 5 nodes, each node being a single process that runs an **identical** binary.  The node software exposes some form of API surface that will accept computational payloads.  For each received computational payload, the node returns a compute identifier and routes the payload to a ZK proving sub-system for processing.  Once processed the resultant proof is shared with the other nodes, each node will retain a local copy of the proof.

A client facing CLI program will allow a user to dispatch a computation payload to a random node.  The CLI program will report to the user the compute identifier.  The user subsequently interrogates a random node for the generated computational proof.  Optionally, the proof itself can subsequently be dispatched to a random node for verification purposes.

# Node Implementation

It is upto the engineer to implement as they see fit according to their ability and experience.  Sub-systems may be either functional or cross-cutting.

Functional sub-systems may include the following:

- a computation executor

- a JSON API

- a proof broadcaster

- a proof store

Cross-cutting sub-systems may include the following:

- a configuration mechanism

- a logging mechanism

- a test framework

- a fault tolerant DevOps setup

# CLI Implementation

The CLI should lightweight and simple to interact with.  It's job is to encapsulate interaction with a node on behalf of a user.  It will render data returned by the node in a simple manner.

# Testing

The following integration positive test should be implemented:

- Generate 1000 payloads of each supported payload type, 2000 payloads in total

- For each generated payload:

    - invoke `do-compute` at a random node and note returned compute-id

    - await 5 seconds
    
    - invoke `get-proof` for all nodes and assert proof equivalence

    - invoke `get-proof-validity` for all nodes and assert truthiness
