# Prelude

This specification constitutes a creative coding exercise.  The purpose of the exercise is to introduce engineers, potentially new to Rust and/or ZK cryptography, to elements of a problem domain that will play a role in a production system designed to support computing ACTUS financial contracts within a set of ZK compute spaces.

The advantage of conducting a creative coding exercise is to allow the engineer and by extension the wider team, to **immediately** be productive in terms of coding and upskilling.  It is highly recommended, but not mandatory, that each engineer endeavours to discover a solution space with as little input from other engineers as possible.  I.E. to minimise short-cuts that ultimately lead to reduced understanding of the problem space.

The exercise solution should be as close as possible to a production system as the engineer is capable of.  This includes implementing cross-cutting concerns such as serialisation, logging, instrumentation, security, dev-ops.  In respect of testing it should thus be at varying degrees of granularity, i.e. unit, functional, integration. 

Once complete the solution will be peer reviewed by other members of the team.  The objective of peer reviews will be to constructively lead to an improved solution. 

# System Overview

The sytem is composed of 5 nodes, each node being a single process that runs an identical binary.  The node software exposes some form of API surface that will accept computational payloads.  For each received computational payload, the node returns a compute identifier and routes the payload to a ZK proving sub-system for processing.  Once processed the resultant proof is shared with the other nodes, each node will retain a local copy of the proof.

A client facing CLI program will allow a user to dispatch a computation payload to a random node.  The CLI program will report to the user the compute identifier.  The user subsequently interrogates a random node for the generated computational proof.  Optionally, the proof itself can subsequently be dispatched to a random node for verification purposes.

# Node Implementation

It is upto the engineer to implement as they see fit according to their ability and experience.  Sub-systems may be either functional or cross-cutting.

Functional sub-systems may include the following:

- a computation executor

- a JSON API

- a proof broadcaster

- a proof store

Cross-cutting sub-systems may include the following:

- a configuration mechanism

- a logging mechanism

- a test framework

- a fault tolerant DevOps setup

# CLI Implementation

The CLI should lightweight and simple to interact with.  It's job is to encapsulate interaction with a node on behalf of a user.  It will render data returned by the node in a simple manner.

# Testing

The following integration positive test should be implemented:

- Generate 1000 payloads of each supported payload type, 2000 payloads in total

- For each generated payload:

    - invoke `do-compute` at a random node and note returned compute-id

    - await 5 seconds
    
    - invoke `get-proof` for all nodes and assert proof equivalence

    - invoke `get-proof-validity` for all nodes and assert truthiness
